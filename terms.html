                        Before initiating legal proceedings, the parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute through good faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration rather than litigation, except for disputes involving intellectual property rights or confidentiality.

                    <p>
                        Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association or other mutually agreed upon arbitration provider. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and in the jurisdiction where Design Studio operates. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the arbitration, except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator.
